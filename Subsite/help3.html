      <h2>Known History of the Earth</h2>
      <p>The Earth is estimated to be around 4.5 billion years old. Its history can be divided into several major geological eras:</p>
      <h3>1. Hadean Eon</h3>
      <p>The Hadean Eon represents the earliest phase of Earth's history, starting with the formation of the planet and lasting until about 4 billion years ago. During this time, the Earth was undergoing intense volcanic activity and frequent impacts from asteroids and comets.</p>
      <h3>2. Archean Eon</h3>
      <p>The Archean Eon spans from about 4 billion to 2.5 billion years ago. It was a time of significant geological changes, including the formation of the first continents, the emergence of early life forms, and the development of an oxygen-rich atmosphere.</p>
      <h3>3. Proterozoic Eon</h3>
      <p>The Proterozoic Eon extends from approximately 2.5 billion to 541 million years ago. It is characterized by the formation of supercontinents, the evolution of complex multicellular life, and the occurrence of significant glaciations.</p>
      <h3>4. Phanerozoic Eon</h3>
      <p>The Phanerozoic Eon began around 541 million years ago and continues to the present day. It is divided into three eras: the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic. This eon witnessed the diversification of life, including the emergence of land plants, the evolution of dinosaurs, the appearance of mammals, and the rise of humans.</p>
      <h3>5. Neoproterozoic Era</h3>
      <p>The Neoproterozoic Era is a subdivision of the Proterozoic Eon, spanning from 1 billion to 541 million years ago. It is characterized by the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia, the emergence of complex life forms, and significant climatic fluctuations, including extensive glaciations.</p>
      <h3>6. Paleozoic Era</h3>
      <p>The Paleozoic Era, also known as the "Age of Ancient Life," lasted from 541 million to 252 million years ago. It witnessed the emergence and diversification of a wide range of marine organisms, including trilobites, brachiopods, and early fish. The Paleozoic Era culminated in the Permian mass extinction, one of the most devastating events in Earth's history.</p>
      <h3>7. Mesozoic Era</h3>
      <p>The Mesozoic Era, often referred to as the "Age of Reptiles," occurred from 252 million to 66 million years ago. It saw the dominance of dinosaurs, the rise of mammals and birds, and the eventual extinction of non-avian dinosaurs due to a catastrophic event, possibly an asteroid impact.</p>
      <h3>8. Cenozoic Era</h3>
      <p>The Cenozoic Era began approximately 66 million years ago and continues to the present day. It is characterized by the diversification and dominance of mammals, including the evolution of humans. The Cenozoic Era also experienced several ice ages and witnessed significant geological and climatic changes.</p>
      <p>In addition to geological changes, the Earth's history is also marked by astronomical events, climate variations, and the impact of human activities. Understanding the history of the Earth provides valuable insights into the planet's past, present, and future.</p>
